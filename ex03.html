    <p>There are many variations of passages of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dQtz1PpY9A" target="_blank"><b><font color="blue">Lorem Ipsum</font></b></a> available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oSIqIqzN3M" target="_blank"><b><font color="green">Lorem Ipsum</font></b></a>, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>
    
    <p><i>All the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnzP32UuDMA" target="_blank"><b><font color="burgundy">Lorem Ipsum</font></b></a> generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</i></p> 
    
    <p><u>It uses a dictionary of over 200 <font color="brown">Latin words</font>, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate <b><font color="red">Lorem Ipsum</font></b> which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</u></p>
